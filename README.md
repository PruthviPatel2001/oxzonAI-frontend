# AI-Based Knowledge-Based Search Retrieval System (Front-End)

## Overview

This repository contains the front-end code for the AI-Based Knowledge-Based Search Retrieval System. The front-end communicates with a Flask application backend that implements the Large Language Model (LLM) component to fulfill the project requirements. This integration enables the system to handle complex, domain-agnostic queries submitted by users.

## Fetures

- Intuitive User Interface: Built with React for a seamless user experience.

- Dynamic Query Submission: Users can input complex queries and receive intelligent responses from the LLM.

- Real-time Interaction: Communicates with the Flask backend for live data retrieval.

## Technologies

- React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.

- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the Flask API.

- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
